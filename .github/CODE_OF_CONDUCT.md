### **The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. The responsibility for upholding these standards is shared by all members of the community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

*   **Examples of representing our community include:** using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
*   **Examples of what is *not* typically considered representing our community include:** expressing a personal opinion on a personal social media account not identified with the project or participating in discussions in a non-project-related online community.

**Principle of Good Faith:** We apply this Code of Conduct based on the principle of good faith. The scope extends to an individual's behavior outside of our spaces only when that behavior can be demonstrated to have a direct and negative impact on the health and safety of our community and its members.

### Enforcement Process

When an incident of potentially unacceptable behavior is reported, community leaders will follow a consistent process:

1.  **Acknowledgment:** The report will be acknowledged promptly to the reporter.
2.  **Investigation:** The incident will be reviewed and investigated in a fair and timely manner. This may involve gathering additional information from the involved parties. Confidentiality will be maintained with regard to the reporter of an incident.
3.  **Resolution:** Based on the findings, appropriate and fair corrective action will be taken, as outlined in the Enforcement Guidelines below.
4.  **Appeal:** Those who have received corrective action have the right to appeal the decision to a designated secondary body (e.g., a steering committee or a different set of community leaders), who will review the case.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

**1. Correction**

*   **Community Impact:** Use of language or behavior that is unprofessional or unwelcome. This may include mild stereotyping, dismissive language, or unwelcome jokes of a personal nature that disrupt a welcoming environment.
*   **Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**2. Warning**

*   **Community Impact:** A violation through a single significant incident or a series of actions, such as sustained unwelcome behavior after a request to stop.
*   **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interaction in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban**

*   **Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, such as public harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments.
*   **Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the involved people is permitted during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**4. Permanent Ban**

*   **Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained harassment, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or any action that fundamentally undermines the safety and health of the community.
*   **Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction with the community.
