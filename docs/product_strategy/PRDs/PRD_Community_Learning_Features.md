# PRD: Community Learning Features

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for Project Hephaestus's Community Learning Features. While our AI provides hyper-personalized education, we recognize the inherent human need for connection and shared learning experiences. This feature aims to combat feelings of isolation in purely self-paced environments, enriching the learning journey through collaborative engagement and peer support, thereby fostering a vibrant and supportive learning ecosystem.

## 2. Introduction: The Problem We're Solving

Learners in self-paced or highly individualized digital environments can often feel isolated, lacking the diverse perspectives, spontaneous help, and peer accountability found in traditional classrooms. This isolation can lead to decreased motivation, unanswered nuanced questions, and missed opportunities for collaborative insight.

Community Learning Features address these challenges by:
*   Fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose among learners.
*   Providing avenues for peer support, discussion, and knowledge exchange that complement AI-driven instruction.
*   Enhancing motivation and accountability through social connection.

The primary value proposition is to **transform an isolated learning journey into a connected, supportive, and mutually enriching experience**, providing additional pathways to clarity and deeper understanding.

## 3. Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** To cultivate a thriving, supportive community that enhances learning outcomes and fosters a sense of belonging among users.
*   **Enrich Learning Experience:** Provide diverse perspectives, collaborative problem-solving opportunities, and peer insights that deepen understanding.
*   **User Retention:** Increase user engagement and long-term retention by building social connections and a sense of shared progress.

## 4. User Stories & User Flow

### 4.1. Key User Stories

*   **As a learner,** I want to ask questions about concepts I'm struggling with and receive helpful responses from other learners or AI facilitators.
*   **As a learner,** I want to share my insights, solutions, or analogies with others to reinforce my own understanding and contribute to the community.
*   **As a learner,** I want to find and connect with other learners who are studying similar topics or have similar learning goals to form study groups.
*   **As a learner,** I want to feel part of a larger community of learners, reducing feelings of isolation and increasing my motivation.

### 4.2. High-Level User Flow

1.  **Community Access:** User navigates to a designated "Community" or "Discussions" section within the platform, accessible from their learning path or dashboard.
2.  **Question/Topic Creation:** User initiates a new post (e.g., question, discussion topic, shared insight) related to a specific concept, module, or general learning challenge. The system intelligently auto-tags the post with relevant concepts based on its content.
3.  **AI Facilitation & Routing:** The system's AI evaluates the post.
    *   For common queries, the AI might provide an immediate, initial answer or link to relevant existing content/explanations from the learning platform.
    *   For complex or novel questions, the AI intelligently routes the question to relevant community forums or suggests specific peers who might be able to help based on their demonstrated mastery (via User Progress Analytics).
4.  **Peer Interaction:** Other learners can view, respond to, and upvote/downvote posts and comments.
5.  **AI-Enhanced Moderation:** The system's AI continuously monitors discussions for adherence to the Code of Conduct, identifies potentially off-topic content, and flags any abusive behavior for review, ensuring a positive environment.
6.  **Progressive Engagement:** Users can subscribe to discussions, receive notifications for responses, and browse trending topics or highly-rated answers.

## 5. High-Level Requirements

*   **Discussion Forums/Q&A Platform:** The system must support asynchronous textual communication, organized by learning topics, modules, or general discussion categories.
*   **AI-Powered Question Routing & Suggestion:** The system must use AI to identify relevant answers from within the platform's content, suggest existing discussions, or recommend peer learners based on their mastery profiles.
*   **AI-Assisted Moderation:** The system must employ semantic AI for real-time scanning of forum content to detect and flag violations of the Code of Conduct (e.g., hate speech, harassment, spam) for review.
*   **User Contribution Recognition:** The system must provide basic mechanisms for recognizing positive community contributions (e.g., "helpful answer" upvotes, badges for active participation â€“ without building a complex reputation system in Phase 2).
*   **Content Tagging & Search:** All community content must be easily searchable and tagged by relevant concepts to improve discoverability.
*   **Integration with Learning Context:** Community discussions should be seamlessly linked from relevant learning modules, allowing users to easily ask questions specific to the content they are currently studying.

## 6. Out of Scope (for initial implementation)

*   Complex social networking profiles, follower/following functionalities, or direct real-time chat.
*   Highly advanced gamification systems solely for community engagement (beyond basic recognition).
*   In-depth analytical dashboards for community managers (beyond basic metrics).
*   Monetization directly from community features (monetization will be driven by core learning and premium features).
*   Peer-to-peer tutoring scheduling or payment functionalities.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   **Active Participation Rate:** Percentage of active users who view or contribute to community discussions.
*   **Question Resolution Rate:** Percentage of user questions posted in the community that receive a helpful response (either from AI or peers).
*   **User Sentiment (Community):** Survey feedback indicating satisfaction with the community and a reduced sense of isolation.
*   **Retention Correlation:** Analyze the correlation between community engagement and user retention rates.

## 8. Dependencies & Assumptions

*   **Dependency:** Accurate and comprehensive User Profiles (via External Authentication Service).
*   **Dependency:** Core AI capabilities for natural language understanding and generation (ADR 003).
*   **Dependency:** User Progress Analytics (PRD: User Progress Analytics) for AI-driven recommendations of peer connections.
*   **Assumption:** Users will be motivated to contribute constructively to a learning-focused community.
*   **Assumption:** The AI's moderation capabilities can effectively manage the majority of community interactions, minimizing manual oversight.
