### **PRD: Interactive Content Generation**

### **1. Overview**

This document outlines the product requirements for Project Hephaestus's Interactive Content Generation feature. This feature is fundamental to our platform's ability to provide personalized, high-quality, and on-demand learning materials, ensuring that users receive explanations and study aids precisely tailored to their needs and current understanding.

### **2. Introduction: The Problem We're Solving**

Learners often struggle with generic, static content that doesn't adapt to their specific questions, prior knowledge, or preferred learning styles. Textbooks can be verbose, lectures may lack clarity, and online resources can be inconsistent in quality and depth. This leads to inefficient learning, wasted time, and a fragmented understanding of complex subjects.

Interactive Content Generation addresses this by:

- Providing on-demand explanations and study materials, eliminating the need for extensive searching.
    
- Ensuring content is directly relevant and appropriately detailed for the individual learner.
    
- Allowing for multiple perspectives and forms of explanation to cater to diverse cognitive needs.
    

### **3. Goals**

- **Primary Goal:** To enable the dynamic, on-demand generation of high-quality, personalized learning content across various formats.
    
- **Content Quality:** Ensure generated content is consistently accurate, clear, and pedagogically sound.
    
- **Adaptability:** Allow content to be adapted in response to user queries, feedback, and performance within personalized paths.
    
- **Learning Efficiency:** Reduce the cognitive load and time learners spend acquiring new information by providing focused, relevant content.
    

### **4. User Stories & User Flow**

#### **4.1. Key User Stories**

- **As a learner (Alex),** I want a concise explanation of a specific microconcept so that I can quickly grasp foundational knowledge.
    
- **As a learner (Maya),** I want an analogy or simplified explanation (ELI5) of a complex concept so that I can connect it to existing knowledge and truly understand it.
    
- **As a learner,** I want to understand why a particular concept is important or how it applies in the real world so that I appreciate its relevance and retain it better.
    
- **As a learner,** I want the content to adapt if I indicate I'm struggling or need more detail on a specific point.
    
- **As a learner,** I want to provide feedback on the generated content so that the system can continuously improve its quality.
    

#### **4.2. Detailed User Flow & Error Handling**

This flow outlines the system process from user request to content delivery, including critical failure points.

1. **Content Request:** User clicks a "Generate Explanation" button for a concept.
    
2. **Prompt Formulation:** The system formulates a detailed prompt for the LLM, including the concept, the requested format (e.g., "Foundational Definition"), and user context (e.g., mastery level).
    
3. **API Call to LLM:** The system sends the request to the Managed LLM API.
    
    - **On Failure (Timeout, 5xx Error):** The system will retry the request once. If the second attempt fails, a UI message will be displayed: "Sorry, we couldn't generate an explanation at this time. Please try again in a few moments." The failure is logged for monitoring.
        
4. **Content Reception:** The system receives the generated text from the LLM.
    
5. **Validation Check:** The generated text is sent to the proprietary Validation Engine API for verification.
    
    - **On Failure (Validation Engine Unavailable):** Treat as a critical failure. Log the error and display the same UI message as the LLM failure.
        
    - **On Rejection (Content Fails Validation):** The system will NOT display the content to the user. The failed content and reason for failure (e.g., low confidence score, factual inconsistency flag) are logged. The user is shown the same UI error message.
        
6. **Content Presentation:** If validated, the generated content is displayed to the user within the learning interface, along with feedback controls (thumbs up/down).
    
7. **User Feedback:** The user interacts with the feedback controls.
    
8. **Feedback Logging:** The feedback event (including content ID, user ID, and feedback type) is sent to our analytics service for tracking.
    

### **5. Functional Requirements**

- **FR-1: Tiered Content Generation:** The system must be able to generate content for a single concept in three distinct formats:
    
    - **FR-1.1: Foundational Definition:** A concise, technically accurate definition. Target length: 30-60 words.
        
    - **FR-1.2: ELI5 Analogy:** A simplified explanation using an analogy or metaphor. Target length: < 150 words. Must not contain condescending language.
        
    - **FR-1.3: Contextual Relevance:** An explanation of why the concept is important or how it is applied. Target length: 50-100 words, including one real-world example.
        
- **FR-2: User Feedback Mechanism:**
    
    - **FR-2.1:** Each piece of generated content must be displayed with a "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" icon.
        
    - **FR-2.2:** Clicking "thumbs up" logs a positive feedback event.
        
    - **FR-2.3:** Clicking "thumbs down" logs a negative feedback event and must trigger a pop-up modal asking for more detail with checkboxes: "Inaccurate," "Unclear," "Irrelevant," and an optional text field.
        
- **FR-3: Adaptive Request:** The system must provide buttons for users to request alternative explanations, such as "Explain it simpler" or "Give another example."
    
- **FR-4: Integration:** Content generation must be seamlessly integrated with the Personalized Learning Paths engine, using the learner's progress to inform the initial content generated.
    

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

- **NFR-1: Performance & Latency:**
    
    - **NFR-1.1:** The P95 latency for a complete user request-to-content-display cycle (including LLM and validation) must be **under 4 seconds**.
        
- **NFR-2: Cost & Scalability:**
    
    - **NFR-2.1:** The system must be architected to handle 1,000 concurrent generation requests.
        
    - **NFR-2.2:** The average cost per successful generation must be monitored and kept below a target of **$0.02**. This is a monitoring goal, not a hard-gate.
        
- **NFR-3: Security:**
    
    - **NFR-3.1:** All user-facing inputs that could be used in a prompt must be sanitized to mitigate prompt injection attacks.
        
    - **NFR-3.2:** No user Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shall be sent to the external LLM API.
        
- **NFR-4: Reliability & Availability:**
    
    - **NFR-4.1:** The content generation service must have a target uptime of **99.8%**. System failures (LLM or Validation Engine) should not cascade to crash the entire learning platform.

### **8. Phased Rollout & MVP Scope**

This project will be delivered in phases to de-risk development and gather user feedback early.

#### **8.1. Phase 1 (MVP)**

The goal of the MVP is to validate the core generation pipeline and user value.

- **IN SCOPE:**
    
    - Generation of **Foundational Definitions (FR-1.1)** only.
        
    - Basic **"thumbs up / thumbs down" feedback (FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3)**, but the follow-up modal is **NOT** required for MVP.
        
    - Full integration with the Validation Engine and error handling as defined.
        
    - All NFRs must be met.
        
- **OUT OF SCOPE for MVP:**
    
    - ELI5 Analogies and Contextual Relevance generation.
        
    - "Explain it simpler" adaptive requests.
        

#### **8.2. Phase 2 (and beyond)**

- Enable ELI5 Analogy and Contextual Relevance generation.
    
- Implement the full feedback modal.
    
- Introduce adaptive response buttons.
    
- Explore AI-generated visual content (diagrams, charts).
    
- Explore voice-to-text and text-to-speech interaction.

### **10. Dependencies & Assumptions**

- **Dependency:** Functionality and availability of the chosen external Managed LLM APIs (per ADR 003).
    
- **Dependency:** The proprietary Validation Engine must be available and meet the API contract defined in section 7.1.
    
- **Dependency:** The Personalized Learning Paths engine must provide the necessary user context (current topic, mastery level) for prompt formulation.
    
- **Assumption:** LLM APIs will continue to provide sufficient quality and cost-effectiveness to meet the defined NFRs at scale.
    
- **Assumption:** The accuracy of the Validation Engine is sufficient to prevent major factual errors from reaching users.
