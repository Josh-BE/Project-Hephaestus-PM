### **PRD: Performance Assessment System**

### **1. Overview**

This document outlines the product requirements for the Performance Assessment System. This feature is fundamental to our platform's commitment to verifiable mastery. It defines our strategy for moving beyond traditional testing to deliver dynamic, actionable assessments that provide users with precise insights into their understanding and guide their journey towards true competence.

This document explicitly acknowledges the significant technical challenges involved and presents a **phased, de-risking strategy** to validate our core hypotheses before a full-scale user launch.

### **2. Introduction: The Problem We're Solving**

Learners often struggle with understanding their true mastery level, frequently confusing recognition with deep understanding. Traditional assessments often fail to pinpoint specific knowledge gaps, provide actionable feedback, or truly measure a learner's ability to apply concepts. This leaves learners with a lack of confidence and an unclear picture of their actual progress.

The Performance Assessment System will address these challenges by:

- Providing objective insight into what learners genuinely know and where their understanding requires reinforcement.
    
- Moving beyond basic recall tests to assess deeper cognitive abilities, including conceptual understanding, contextual relevance, and practical application.
    
- Empowering learners with clarity on their progress and confidence in their acquired skills.
    

### **3. Goals**

- **Foundational Goal: Prove Technical Viability.** Before all else, scientifically validate that our AI can evaluate complex, free-form user responses with an accuracy comparable to human subject matter experts.
    
- **Primary Goal: Precisely Guide Learner Mastery.** Accurately identify a learner's current mastery level across specific concepts and skills, guiding them with targeted feedback toward full competence.
    
- **User Trust & Confidence:** Build user trust in their own capabilities and in the platform's assessment accuracy by providing transparent, reliable, and actionable feedback.
    
- **AI System Refinement:** Generate high-quality data on user performance and common misconceptions to create a flywheel effect, continuously refining the core AI learning experience.
    

### **4. Phased Rollout & De-risking Strategy**

This project's success is entirely dependent on the accuracy of its AI evaluation core. Therefore, we will adopt a phased approach to systematically de-risk our core assumptions. Each phase has distinct goals, metrics, and exit criteria.

- **Phase 0: Core Technology Validation (Internal Spike - No UI)**
    
    - **Goal:** Determine if an LLM-based system can achieve near-human accuracy in evaluating free-form responses against a defined rubric. This is a go/no-go phase for the entire initiative.
        
    - **Process:** Engineering will take a curated dataset of 100+ scenarios and corresponding user answers, previously graded by at least two human experts. The AI's evaluation will be directly compared against the expert consensus.
        
    - **Exit Criteria:** The AI evaluation must achieve a **>90% correlation** with the consensus grade from human experts. A formal go/no-go decision will be made by product and engineering leadership based on these results.
        
- **Phase 1: Internal Alpha (Dogfooding with Full Human Oversight)**
    
    - **Goal:** Refine the AI models and the user feedback loop in a controlled environment.
        
    - **Process:** Deploy the full user flow (as described in Section 6) to a small group of internal employees. **Every single AI evaluation will be reviewed and approved/corrected by a human expert before being shown to the user.** This creates a critical data-gathering and model-tuning loop.
        
    - **Exit Criteria:** Achieve >95% AI accuracy (i.e., requiring no human correction) on live evaluations. Collect qualitative feedback demonstrating that the feedback is clear, actionable, and helpful.
        
- **Phase 2: Closed Beta Launch**
    
    - **Goal:** Validate the end-to-end user experience, its impact on learning, and user trust with a cohort of real users.
        
    - **Process:** Launch the feature to a select group of beta users. Human review will be scaled back to a spot-checking/auditing process (e.g., reviewing 10% of evaluations) via the Validation Engine.
        
    - **Exit Criteria:** Demonstrate positive results across the full suite of success metrics, including Mastery Progression Rate and User Confidence Scores.
        

### **5. User Stories & User Flow (Target State - Phase 2)**

#### **5.1. Key User Stories**

- As a learner, I want to take scenario-based assessments so that I can prove my ability to apply concepts in practical situations.
    
- As a learner, I want to receive detailed, AI-generated feedback immediately after an assessment so that I understand exactly why my answer was correct or incorrect.
    
- As a learner, I want to see a clear visual representation of my progress towards mastering a skill or course goal so that I feel motivated and understand my journey.
    
- As a learner, I want the system to recommend specific learning modules based on my assessment results so that I can efficiently fill my identified knowledge gaps.
    

#### **5.2. High-Level User Flow**

1. **Assessment Initiation:** User is prompted to take an assessment at a strategic point in their personalized learning path, or can initiate one for a specific concept.
    
2. **Scenario Presentation:** The system dynamically presents a scenario-based, free-response question designed to test application of concepts.
    
3. **User Response Submission:** User provides their free-form answer or solution to the scenario.
    
4. **AI Evaluation & Feedback Delivery:** The system processes the user's response, evaluates it against the expected outcome and underlying principles, and immediately presents comprehensive feedback.
    
5. **Progress Update:** The user's Mastery Rubric and personalized learning path are updated to reflect their performance, guiding future learning recommendations.
    

### **6. High-Level Requirements**

- **Co-Generated Evaluation Framework:** For every scenario generated, the system must also generate a detailed, machine-readable rubric. This rubric will define the key principles to be assessed, expected components of a correct answer, and common misconceptions. **This is the ground truth for the AI evaluation.**
    
- **Scenario-Based Free-Response Assessment Generation:** The system must be capable of dynamically generating unique, relevant, and evaluable scenarios requiring free-form responses that test application.
    
- **Robust Evaluation Engine:** The evaluation engine must be resilient to a wide range of free-form user responses, identifying core understanding despite variations in phrasing by using the co-generated rubric.
    
- **Comprehensive AI-Driven Feedback:** The system must provide immediate, granular feedback that explains why an answer was correct or incorrect, linking back to specific concepts and recommending targeted remedial content.
    
- **Mastery Tracking System:** The system must continuously track and visualize a user's progress against a predefined Mastery Rubric for each concept and skill.
    
- **Integration with Personalized Learning Paths:** Assessment results must seamlessly inform and adjust the user's personalized learning journey.
    
- **Adaptive Assessment Difficulty:** The system must adjust the complexity and type of assessment questions based on the user's ongoing performance and knowledge graph.
    

### **7. Out of Scope**

- **Fully automated evaluation in initial phases.** Human-in-the-loop is a core requirement for Phase 1 and for quality assurance in Phase 2.
    
- Certification generation (covered in later phases).
    
- AI generation of specific visual/diagrammatic assessment questions (initial focus on text-based scenarios).
    
- Proctored or high-stakes examination functionality for formal academic credit.
