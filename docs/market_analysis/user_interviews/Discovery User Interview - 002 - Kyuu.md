### **1. The Opener: Context & Permission (1 min)**

"Hi **Kyuu**, thanks so much for your time. My name is **[Your Name]**, and I'm doing some research to understand the reality of how students at **[Their University]** manage their workload for demanding courses.

To be clear, there's nothing to buy—this isn't a sales pitch. This is purely for research. My goal is just to learn from your experience. There are no right or wrong answers.

Would you be open to walking me through how you handle your studies? It should only take about 10 minutes."

### **2. The Narrative: Uncovering the Workflow (3 mins)**

**Primary Question:** "Could you walk me through the last time you studied for a major exam or worked on a significant assignment? Just start from the beginning—where were you, what was the subject, and what did you do first?"

*   **Kyuu's Response:** "To be honest, I never really 'studied' in the traditional sense. My main approach was to just do the homework every single day. The homework felt like the study material itself. So for a class like Math, I'd be in my room, open the textbook, and just start grinding through the assigned problems. That was my routine."

**Follow-up Probes (Listen and use as needed):**

*   "Tell me more about that moment. What was on your screen?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "Mostly just the textbook and my notebook. If I was writing an essay or needed to improve my wording on an assignment, I would use AI tools to help me phrase things better."
*   "You mentioned you used [Tool, e.g., YouTube]. What did you search for? What were you hoping to find?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "With the AI tools, I wasn't searching for answers, but better ways to express my ideas. I was hoping to find more sophisticated wording, especially when the material was complex."
*   "Then what did you do?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "I just pushed through it to overcome any potential for failure. If I got stuck, I knew I had to ask questions in class the next day or find a tutor in my AVID class."
*   "How long did that specific part take?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "The homework was an everyday thing. It wasn't a quick 30-minute task; it would take hours every night, basically consuming all my free time."

### **3. The Problem: Pinpointing Frustration & Impact (2 mins)**

**Primary Question:** "Thanks for that detail. In the process you just described, what was the most frustrating or difficult part?"

*   **Kyuu's Response:** "The most frustrating part was the constant pressure to be a perfect student with high scores at the top. The stress came when the material was suddenly above my level. One moment I felt comfortable, and the next, I was completely lost. Also, missing a single day of class screws you over completely."

**Follow-up Probes:**

*   "That sounds tough. What made it so frustrating?" (Dig for the root cause)
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "It was frustrating because any setback felt like a direct threat to my goal of being a top student. It created this feeling that I was on the edge of failure, and I had to constantly push through that stress."
*   "When you hit that roadblock with [The Frustrating Part, e.g., missing a day of class], what was the immediate consequence? How did it affect the rest of your study session or your day?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "It was immediate panic. I'd have to scramble to find out what I missed. It completely derailed my schedule because I then had to focus on catching up on top of the new homework for that day."
*   "How often does something like that happen?" (Let them quantify it without giving them options).
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "The feeling of the material being too difficult would happen a few times a semester in tough courses, and it was always a major hurdle. Missing a day was rare, but the impact was huge every time."

### **4. The Cost of the Problem: Exploring Workarounds & Costs (2 mins)**

**Primary Question:** "When you run into [The Specific Problem they mentioned, like falling behind after missing a class], what do you do to get past it?"

*   **Kyuu's Response:** "The first thing I'd do is call friends to get a picture of their notes. After that, I would make sure to go to the teacher for help. I was always asking questions in class. I also had an AVID class, which provided tutors for all subjects, and I used that resource a lot."

**Follow-up Probes:**

*   "Tell me about the tools or methods you've tried. What do you like about your current approach? What are the downsides?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "I liked having people I could rely on. But the downside was the personal cost. To keep up and stay focused, I had to drop friends and relationships. That was the biggest sacrifice for school."
*   "Have you ever spent money trying to solve this, like buying a specific app, a book, or hiring a tutor for this type of issue?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "I hired a tutor for math once when I was younger, for multiplication, but I never bought any extra books. The school provided everything, and the AVID program gave me access to free tutors."
*   "What's the worst part about the solutions you've tried? What do they not get right?"
    *   **Kyuu's Response:** "The worst part is that even after all that—the sacrifices, the stress, getting the diploma and honors—the effort didn't feel worth it. The achievement felt hollow because of how much I had to struggle to get there."

### **5. The Close: Gratitude & Future Permission (2 mins)**

"This has been incredibly helpful. The part you mentioned about **how missing a single day could screw you over and the stress that came when the material was suddenly above your level** gave me a lot to think about. I really appreciate your honesty.

As I mentioned, this is for research. I'm still exploring if there's a real way to solve some of these issues. If, and only if, I develop a tool that I think could specifically help with **the pressure of catching up and managing those moments when the coursework feels overwhelming**, would you be open to me reaching out in a few months to get your opinion on it?

Finally, is there anyone else you know who takes their studies seriously and might have an interesting perspective on this?

Thanks again."
