### **Diagnosed Interview with Oni (Time Management & Distraction Focus)**

**Subject:** Oni (University Student + Freelance Editor/Filmmaker)  
**Core Problem:** **Distraction-driven procrastination** fueled by perfectionism and "all-or-nothing" thinking.

---

#### **1. The Opener: Context & Permission**

> _"Hi Oni, thanks for your time. I’m researching how students like you at [University] manage demanding workloads. This isn’t a sales pitch, just a 10-minute chat to learn from your experience. Would you walk me through how you handle your studies?"_

**Oni’s Context:**

- Balances **freelance editing/film work** + **academic deadlines** → high stress.
- Struggles with **time blindness** and **perfectionism** ("if I can’t do it perfectly, I don’t start").
- Uses **kitchen timers** as a workaround → ineffective against deep distractions.

---

#### **2. The Narrative: Uncovering the Workflow**

**Primary Question:** _"Walk me through the last time you studied for a major exam or worked on a big assignment. Where were you? What did you do first?"_

**Oni’s Workflow (Reconstructed):**

1. **Environment:** Works in his room → **high-distraction zone** (easy access to phone/bed).
2. **Initiation:** Sits down to work → **mind wanders immediately** ("mind was somewhere else").
3. **Distraction Trigger:** Opens phone → **doomscrolling** (social media, videos).
4. **Attempted Solution:** Sets a **kitchen timer** (e.g., 25 mins) → ignores it or pauses it to scroll.
5. **Outcome:** Task abandoned → **"lounging around"** → guilt over wasted time.

**Key Probes Applied:**

- _"What was on your screen when you got distracted?"_ → Social media, YouTube.
- _"How long did the distraction last?"_ → Hours (unquantified but "feels like a wasted day").

#### **3. The Problem: Pinpointing Frustration & Impact**

**Primary Question:** _"What was the most frustrating part of that process?"_

**Oni’s Frustrations:**

- **Root Cause:** **Perfectionism** → "If I can’t complete the task perfectly, I don’t start."
- **Immediate Consequence:** **Doomscrolling** → temporary escape from pressure.
- **Impact:**
    
    - **Stress buildup** from looming deadlines (school + freelance).
    - **"All-or-nothing" mindset** → feels like a failure if even _one_ task isn’t done.
    - **Masking** struggles → hides stress from others, increasing isolation.
    
- **Frequency:** Happens "often" → daily struggle.

**Probes Applied:**

- _"What made it so frustrating?"_ → Knowing he’s "fucking up" but feeling powerless to stop.
- _"How did it affect your day?"_ → Lost momentum, heightened anxiety, self-loathing.

#### **4. The Cost of the Problem: Workarounds & Costs**

**Primary Question:** _"When you run into distraction, how do you try to get past it?"_

**Oni’s Solutions & Their Downsides:**

|**Solution**|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|---|---|---|
|**Kitchen Timer**|Simple, no cost|Easy to ignore; doesn’t address root cause (perfectionism/anxiety).|
|**"Just start"**|Logical self-awareness|Perfectionism paralyzes action.|
|**Changing Rooms**|Temporary focus boost|Not sustainable; distractions follow him.|

**Costs:**

- **Financial:** None (hasn’t bought apps/tools).
- **Emotional:** High → anxiety, guilt, shame, burnout.
- **Opportunity:** Lost income (freelance delays), missed learning.

**Probes Applied:**

- _"What’s the worst part about your current solutions?"_ → "They don’t stop my brain from sabotaging me."

#### **5. The Close: Gratitude & Future Permission**

> _"Thanks, Oni, this was incredibly helpful. Your struggle with perfectionism leading to doomscrolling really stood out. If I develop a tool to help with distraction or task initiation, could I reach out in a few months for your thoughts? Also, is there anyone else you know who might share similar challenges?"_

**Oni’s Likely Response:**

- Open to future contact (if solution addresses **perfectionism** or **momentum-building**).
- May refer peers in **creative fields** (film/marketing students facing similar pressures).

### **Key Insights for Product/Service Development**

1. **Target Perfectionism First:** Solutions must address the **"all-or-nothing" mindset** (e.g., micro-tasking, celebrating partial wins).
2. **Distraction = Symptom:** Tools should tackle **underlying anxiety** (e.g., guided focus sessions, stress-reduction prompts).
3. **Environment Matters:** Help users create **distraction-free zones** (e.g., app-based room-locking, accountability partners).
4. **Momentum > Time Tracking:** Oni needs help **starting**, not just timing. (e.g., "5-minute rule" enforcers).
5. **Creative Professionals:** Tailor for **freelancer/student hybrids** (deadline syncing, project segmentation).

**Next Step:** Prototype a tool that combines **micro-tasking** + **distraction-blocking** + **progress visualization** to combat perfectionism and build momentum. Test with users like Oni.
