# ADR 002: Select PostgreSQL as the Primary Relational Database

## 1. Context

Project Hephaestus requires a robust, reliable, and scalable database solution to manage critical structured data. This includes user profiles, personalized learning path definitions, progress tracking against mastery rubrics, assessment results, and metadata associated with AI-generated content (e.g., content IDs, versioning, quality scores). Given the platform's vision for deep understanding and personalized learning for billions of users, the database choice must ensure strong data integrity, support complex queries, and be capable of evolving with the platform's sophisticated pedagogical model.

## 2. Decision

The decision is to **select PostgreSQL as the primary relational database** for Project Hephaestus. It will be utilized through a managed service (e.g., Supabase, AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) to align with our serverless-first and low-operational-overhead strategy.

## 3. Alternatives Considered

- **MySQL/MariaDB:**
    
    - Pros: Widely popular, well-supported, good for general-purpose relational data.
        
    - Cons: Less feature-rich compared to PostgreSQL for advanced data types or extensibility (e.g., native JSON support, complex indexing options); potentially less performant for very complex analytical queries common in learning platforms.
        
- **NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB):**
    
    - Pros: High horizontal scalability, flexible schema, good for very large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
        
    - Cons: Lacks strong ACID compliance (critical for user progress and financial data); complex transactions are harder; less suited for highly relational data that defines user-course relationships and mastery hierarchies; managing complex joins or relationships is cumbersome. (While useful for certain aspects like activity logs, not ideal as a primary database).
        
- **Specialized Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j):**
    
    - Pros: Excellent for highly connected data like knowledge graphs or complex learning path relationships.
        
    - Cons: Niche technology, higher learning curve, potentially higher operational costs; less suitable for traditional tabular data like user profiles or simple assessments; might be overkill for initial data modeling.
        

## 4. Consequences (Pros & Cons of the Decision)

### 4.1. Positive Consequences (Why PostgreSQL Aligns with Our Vision)

- **Strong Data Integrity (ACID Compliance):** Essential for reliable tracking of user progress, mastery status, and assessment results. Ensures that critical learning data is always consistent and trustworthy.
    
- **Robustness & Reliability:** PostgreSQL is a mature, battle-tested database known for its stability and reliability in production environments.
    
- **Advanced Features & Extensibility:**
    
    - **JSONB Support:** Provides native support for JSON data types, offering schema flexibility (semi-structured data) within a relational framework. This is crucial for evolving AI-generated content metadata or flexible assessment structures without constant schema migrations.
        
    - **Custom Functions & Extensions:** Supports powerful custom functions and a rich ecosystem of extensions, allowing for complex pedagogical logic or analytical queries directly within the database.
        
- **Complex Querying Capabilities:** Excellent performance for complex analytical queries (e.g., aggregating user performance across modules, identifying learning patterns) necessary for AI refinement and personalized feedback.
    
- **Scalability:** Capable of both vertical scaling (more powerful instances) and horizontal scaling (read replicas, sharding strategies in later phases), enabling it to support a growing user base. Managed services simplify this.
    
- **Active Community & Ecosystem:** Large and active developer community, extensive documentation, and wide tool support.
    

### 4.2. Negative Consequences (Challenges & Mitigations)

- **Less Flexible Schema than Pure NoSQL (Mitigated by JSONB):** While flexible with JSONB, it's still fundamentally a relational database. Significant schema changes require migrations.
    
    - Mitigation: Utilize JSONB for evolving, less structured attributes within records. Plan schema changes carefully and use database migration tools.
        
- **Scalability for Purely Unstructured Data (Mitigated by Other ADRs):** PostgreSQL is not optimized for petabytes of raw, unstructured data (like raw ingested learning materials or large text chunks for AI processing).
    
    - Mitigation: This is explicitly addressed by **ADR-004-ObjectStorageForUnstructuredContent.md**, where cloud object storage will handle large unstructured data. PostgreSQL will store only metadata and relational links to these objects.
        
- **Performance for Extremely High Write Throughput of Simple Data:** While generally performant, for very high-volume, simple write operations (e.g., individual clickstream events), a specialized time-series or NoSQL database might offer higher raw throughput.
    
    - Mitigation: Analyze data access patterns. For truly high-volume, ephemeral event data, a separate specialized database (e.g., a message queue to a data lake for analytics) might be considered in a later phase. PostgreSQL remains the source of truth for core user and learning state.
        

## 5. Status

Accepted. PostgreSQL serves as the robust and reliable foundation for managing Project Hephaestus's critical structured learning data, aligning with our principles of data integrity, scalability, and long-term extensibility.
